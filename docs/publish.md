## Publishing Notebooks

### 1. Publishing Notebooks

To publicly share a notebook, click the checkbox next to that notebook and then click the "Publish" button on the toolbar above.
This will open a dialog with a short form, prompting you to enter the author's name, the quality and a brief description. Fill out this information and then click the "Publish" button on the dialog.
Your notebook should now be available to the public and should appear on the "Public Notebooks" tab. The published version of the notebook is a checkpoint of the notebook at the time it was published. Any changes you make to the notebook in the future are not copied over to the published version unless you explicitly choose to update the notebook in the public repository.


### 2. Updating or Removing a Public Notebook

You can update or remove a notebook that you have made public by first clicking the checkbox next to the notebook and then clicking the "Publish" button.
In the dialog that comes up you will have the option to edit any of the notebook's metadata, such as author name, description, etc.
To update or remove the notebook, click the "Update" or "Unpublish" buttons, respectively.
