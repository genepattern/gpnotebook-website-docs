# GenePattern Notebook documentation

**GenePattern Notebook** is the first system to integrate the dynamic
capabilities of notebook systems with an investigator-focused,
easy-to-use interface that provides access to hundreds of genomic tools
without the need to write code.

Furthermore, GenePattern Notebook enhances the user experience by
providing additional services such as, **the Python UIBuilder**, which
converts any python function into an interative widget, and **a Rich
text editor**, which allows a user to format notes and documentation in
a notebook in much the same way that one might use Microsoft Word or
Libre Office

How to install:

**pip**

```
pip install genepattern-notebook
```

**conda**

```
conda install -c genepattern genepattern-notebook 
```
