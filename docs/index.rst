### GenePattern and Jupyter Notebook

<a href="http://genepattern.org"><img src="http://genepattern-notebook.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/genepattern.png" width=50px style="float: left; margin: 5px;"></a> [**GenePattern**](https://genepattern.org) provides hundreds of analytical tools for the analysis of gene expression (RNA-seq and microarray), sequence variation and copy number, proteomic, flow cytometry, and network analysis. These tools are all available through a Web interface with no programming experience required.

<a href="https://jupyter.org"><img src="http://genepattern-notebook.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/jupyter.png" width=50px style="float: left; margin: 5px;"></a> [**Jupyter Notebook**](https://jupyter.org) is a web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. If you are unfamiliar with the Jupyter Notebook environment, we recommend you take a look at the [**Jupyter Quickstart Guide**](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content-quickstart.html)

### What is GenePattern Notebook?

The [**GenePattern Notebook**](http://genepattern-notebook.org) environment integrates GenePattern's analysis platform with the Jupyter Notebook system, allowing researchers to create documents that interleave formatted text, graphics and other multimedia, executable code, and GenePattern analyses, creating a single "research narrative" that puts scientific discussion and analyses in the same place. This tutorial will familiarize you with some of its most important features.
